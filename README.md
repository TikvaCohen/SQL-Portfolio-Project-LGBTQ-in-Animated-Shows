This was a self-made project that took data mined from BussinessInsider.com (https://www.businessinsider.com/lgbtq-cartoon-characters-kids-database-2021-06?page=explore-database) called "259 LGBTQ characters in cartoons that bust the myth that kids can't handle inclusion".  This data was mined by Bradd Carey on Kaggle.
The second and third datasets came from A_N_Wilson who was inspired by Bradd Carey's original data.  She mined Wikipedia articles and created two data sets.

These datasets have been added to this account, but only the SQL code is mine.

I utilized SQL to perform analysis on the data and discern patterns between representation, status, ratings, and platforms. The goal of this project was to examine trends in the representation of LGBTQ+ characters.  To display the findings a Tableau Presentation was created to help showcase patterns.
